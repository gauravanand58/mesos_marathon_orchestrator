#### This repository contains code for an application, which performs two tasks using two services in parallel.
#### The first service is used to find factorial values of 100 random numbers. The second service calculates Fibonacci sequence of 100 random numbers given in a text file.
#### Both the services run in parallel on Apache Mesos agent node installed on AWS EC2 Ubuntu 16.04 virtual machine with 4vCPUs and 16 GB RAM.
#### In addition, Marathon framework is used here to orchestrate the tasks or services according to the availbale resources.
#### Finally, graphs of N value (input) and time of calculation are generated for both the services.
